# Bits and Bytes Series: Canadian Census Discovery Portal (Sept. 22, 2020)

This page provides a presentation on the **Canadian Census Discovery Portal** as part of the Bits and Bytes Webinar Series hosted by the Map \& Data Library that features presentations and demonstrations on data\-related topics and tools, such as web archives, visualization, GIS and statistics.

**Presentation Description:**

*September 22, 2020, 2:00pm, presented by Leanne Trimble*  
This talk introduces the Canadian Census Discovery Portal project, an initiative that aims to inventory all census data released in what is now Canada (from the first census in 1665 New France to the present day), and make the inventory available through an open, bilingual, searchable portal. The project will bring together existing census data, some of which is "hidden" to many Canadians, and make it more accessible, usable, and ensure its availability for the long term. This talk is being held on this date in celebration of[Endangered Data Week](https://endangereddataweek.org/ "https://endangereddataweek.org/"),  an event which aims to foster an environment of data consciousness and promote care for endangered collections.
